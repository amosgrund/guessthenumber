You will not win this game.

Guess a number from 1 to 10.

If your guess is equal to the generated number, a new number will be generated until they are not equal.

No, the number is not generated to decide if you won or lost, there is no message in this code saying that you won.

The number is just generated to tell you what the "right" number would have been.

Have fun never guessing the right number out of ten!
